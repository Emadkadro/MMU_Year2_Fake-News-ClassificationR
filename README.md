Fake News Detection

## Problem Statement

The ISOT Fake News Dataset used for fake news detection that consists of two separate files: 
One containing fake news articles and 
The other containing real news articles. 
The fake news articles were collected from unreliable websites such as flagged by Politifact, while the real news articles were sourced from reputable news providers such as Reuters. The dataset is relatively balanced, with approximately the same number of real and fake news articles.
The problem will be approached using two predictive models: *Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbuors (KNN)*, which are effective for text-based classification problems.
